# Background

Recently, I bought a second-hand laptop for training my Linux skill. However, after I installed Ubuntu 18.04, the WIFI doesn't work, I know the hardware no problem, because I tested it with Win7 and Win10.
This laptop uses Broadcom BCM43228 for the wireless hardware, you can see a lot of articles saw have the same issue with this one on the internet.

I will list some solutions that should be fix this problem,

- Laptop: DELL Latitude 6430S
- Wireless hardware: Broadcom Limited BCM43228
- Operating Systemï¼š Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop

- `rfkill`

## Check the wireless hardware

`sudo lspci | grep Network`

It will show you the wireless hardware model, in the case my result is Broadcom BCM43228.

An easy way to fix this can use `sudo apt update` then `sudo apt install--reinstall bcmwl-kernel-source` to update the driver.

If you a luck guy, the WiFi should be work after you reboot system.

If not, let's do another way

## Check the wireless hardware detail
`sudo lshw -C network`
